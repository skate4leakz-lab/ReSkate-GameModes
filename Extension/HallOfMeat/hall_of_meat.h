// Hall of Meat, as in skate. 3: when the local skater bails, the bones it hurt show over the
// world, yellow where a hit bruised one and red where one broke it, with the bail's card, its
// time and Meat counting until the body comes to rest; both stay a second after the skater gets
// up, then fade out. A bone breaking flashes the screen's edges red and, in single player, slows
// the game down a moment (hall_of_meat_slow_motion.h).
//
// Each physics step of the local skater (hall_of_meat_skater.h) feeds the bail
// (hall_of_meat_model.h): what each body hit, and whether it is a ragdoll. The skeleton is skate.'s
// own skeleton mesh (hall_of_meat_skeleton.h) posed as the renderer draws the skater
// (hall_of_meat_render.h); the card (hall_of_meat_card.h) takes the place of skate.'s bottom left HUD
// while it shows (hall_of_meat_hud.h). The overlay draws both (hall_of_meat_overlay.h). Each map's best
// Meat is saved with the profile.

// does not change with its key, though. It still names the store item's
// appearance preset, decal textures, object or gesture, and those are what this
// check holds a mod's items against. A mod that adds such a copy is not loaded
// at all: the merge leaves it out whole (mod_merge.cpp), as it does a mod that
// cannot be merged.

// All such a mod is told, in the launcher, the game and the log (which the
// mod's author reads too): that it could not be merged, and this. Nothing of
// what was looked for or found. The number is how ReSkate's own people tell it
